Project Title: E-commerce product page

This README file is a personal note to self to record the things I learnt, found challenging, and problems I am yet to solve so I can revisit in future for reference purposes.

This project was for further practice of my SASS and JavaScript skills. I realized I am getting more competent and comfortable with writing JavaScript without having to contact AI for syntax errors, and I really enjoy using SASS because of how powerful and extensive it is.

Asides re-inforcing my JavaScript and SASS knowledge, I didn't learn much from this project. One interesting new thing I learnt, however, is how I can combine SASS mixins and media queries so I can comfortably write code for responsive layout. I create a mixin in my mixin partial that can have as many breakpoints I want, and then I use the if/else...if statement to include as many breakpoints I want.

I included just 2 breakpoints (over 1000px and below 990px) because I believe the best responsive layout code is the one that has the least amount of breakpoints that works across all screensizes. But I believe this will also depend on the complexity of the project.

I should also note that I did not complete this project. I think I have done the most important parts, and can upload it as it is. I have more important things to move on to, and I don't think the opportunity cost of finishing the project is worth it when I can be doing something more important.
